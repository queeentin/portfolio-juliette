Conceived with Julien Bobroff for his upcoming talks, here is a collection of tools designed to recount and illustrate some of the most extreme experiments in current physics research. The presentation it enables also becomes extreme in its own way: each chapter fits... in a matchbox! A microscope is sometimes needed to observe the world's smallest talk. The lecture draws from 8 boxes, each corresponding to an experience: from the most tiny and delicate to the most violent! Each conference features 4 boxes and can be "played" each time, with a new combination of chapters. The colored backgrounds on which they are played also become a support for explanations, presenting the scales of units corresponding to the records broken.
