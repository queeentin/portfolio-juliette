“À propos de ce qui se passe” can be seen as the demo reel for a fictional television program. It begins with a collection of objects, akin to game tokens, illustrating terms taken from selected newspaper articles. Intended to be filmed, these objects are then used in performances or videos, during which they are manipulated to explain various news items in images. This analog tool offers a return to photomontage, and can exist in both still and animated forms. Evoking both old television techniques and educational games for children, it allows us to question our relationship with the media and the new forms of writing they face. Constructed like a marabout-boutdeficelle, the first episode (pilot) attempts to establish my personal relationship with information (text and images combined) through a hybrid narrative combining current affairs and media archaeology. The Fertile Crescent, September 11, 2001, the Syrian conflict, the Mediterranean, fake news, Europe... Jean-Luc Godard, Jean Baudrillard and Tino Rossi all feature.
