A 6-month project residency about nuclear waste and how to communicate its existence to
future generations. I produced a "Technogony" (techno- for technic, -gony for genesis), a short

with Elisabetta Spaggiari and Philippine Brenac. 

With the support of Le Signe, Centre national du Graphisme, and ANDRA, the French national radioactive waste management agency
