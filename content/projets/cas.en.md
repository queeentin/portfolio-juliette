In 2024, during a further training course in Pedagogical Theater at the ZhDK (Zürich, CH), I produced a collection of tools to develop workshops open to all. 
In the form of games and language workshops, I was looking to see how the manipulation of images and objects can support public speaking, and provoke personal testimony, narration or discussion.
