A 6-month project residency about nuclear waste and how to communicate its existence to
future generations. I produced a "Technogony" (techno- for technic, -gony for genesis), a short
story about the origin of nuclear waste, which we staged in a shadow theater in collaboration
with Elisabetta Spaggiari and Philippine Brenac.
