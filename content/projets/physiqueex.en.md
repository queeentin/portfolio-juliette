Illustrations and figures for the book “La Physique de l'Extrême” by Julien Bobroff, published by Albin Michel.
This book relates 11 recent experiments in physics, which have driven researchers to break records:
From the lowest temperature to the largest magnetic field, from the most precise balance to the most powerful microscope... Inspired by scientific diagrams and engravings, the illustrations attempt to twist those codes to evoke these extra-ordinary experiments.
