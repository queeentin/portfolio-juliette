In 2019, as part of the 3rd edition of Création en Cours, supported by Ateliers Médicis, I'm offering the manipulated objects device to the pupils of Madam Legendre's CM1/CM2 class at Rachecourt-sur-Marne school (52). I invite them to imagine fake news based on real newspaper headlines. Notre-Dame is burning, roundabouts are occupied, just about everywhere in France... In this “spin off” episode, we hear fake stories with the occasional bit of truth - which always comes out of the mouths of children.
