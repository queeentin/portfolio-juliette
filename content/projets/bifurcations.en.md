A device designed for a multiple choice conference. A collection of cardboard and paper objects handled by Julien Bobroff during a conference where the public is asked to vote to choose the path it takes. The aim was to tell different stories linked to the discovery of magnetism, but above all to illustrate how scientific discoveries are made: sometimes by taking side roads. A project developed during my residency with [La Physique Autrement](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/supraconductivite/projet/toktoks/).
